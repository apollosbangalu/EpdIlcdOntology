# EPD+ILCD Dataset Ontology

## Overview
The Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) and International Life Cycle Data (ILCD) Dataset Ontology is a semantic web knowledge model for representing environmental product declarations of building materials and products within the construction industry. Version 0.1 of this ontology provides a comprehensive framework for describing environmental impacts, life cycle assessments, and related properties according to the EPD+ILCD format.

## Description
The ontology provides a taxonomy and vocabulary to describe Environmental Product Declarations of building materials and products, with their corresponding properties and individuals relevant within the construction industry. It follows the EPD+ILCD Format to enable semantic interoperability solutions within the knowledge domain. This ontology is developed strictly for research purposes.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive environmental impact indicator representation
- Detailed life cycle assessment structure
- Administrative and validation information framework
- Hierarchical classification system for building materials
- Standardised units and measurements
- Process data set management

## Core Components

### 1. Main Classes
- **BuildingProductOrMaterial**: Root class for building products and materials
- **ProcessDataSet**: Container for EPD process information
- **EnvironmentalIndicator**: Framework for environmental impact measurements
- **AdministrativeInformation**: Management of metadata and ownership
- **ClassificationOrCategory**: Hierarchical classification structure

### 2. Environmental Indicators
#### Core Indicators
- Global Warming Potential (GWP)
- Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP)
- Acidification Potential (AP)
- Eutrophication Potential (EP)
- Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP)

#### Resource Use Indicators
- Use of renewable primary energy (PERE)
- Use of non-renewable primary energy (PENRE)
- Use of secondary materials (SM)
- Use of water resources (FW)

#### Waste Categories

- Non-hazardous waste disposed (NHWD)
- Radioactive waste disposed (RWD)

### 3. Life Cycle Phases
- Raw Material Supply (A1)
- Transport (A2)
- Manufacturing (A3)
- Construction Process (A4-A5)
- Use Stage (B1-B7)
- End of Life (C1-C4)
- Benefits and Loads Beyond System Boundary (D)
