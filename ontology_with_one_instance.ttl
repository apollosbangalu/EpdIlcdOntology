All of the phases were allocated on 2020 production, for which it was possible to calculate the impact of a declared unit equivalent to one square metter of product.


Excluded from this study are:
showrooms in Padua and Milan;
travel and transport of company employees;
steel tray printing (carried out by a subcontractor);
the galvanised steel structures which support the floors (carried out by a subcontractor).
On the other hand, the following were considered within the 5% cut-off:
talc used occasionally on the aluminium foil gluing line considering the small quantities;
labels and scotch tape used for the packaging of the finished product;
the packaging of raw materials;
the transport by sea of the vinyl finishing from the Irish supplier.""" ;

These indicators include the use of renewable and non-renewable primary energy, secondary materials, secondary fuels, and fresh water resources. These inputs are fundamental for understanding the resource depletion impacts and efficiency of building materials and products in accordance with the EPD+ILCD methodology." ;
